# ChilinDashBoard

> This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.6.

Me and Chris use Angular to write this dashboard for professor's online experiment. 
So that the professor can track each attendee's progress by a glance, and gain detail information by the list below the page.

web page's demo url: https://dashboard202009.eason.tw/
(build form this project's code)

The backend of the experiment was written by us using Python, too. But it have some sensitive information so we only provide this page and the demo-oriented json file for demo.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
